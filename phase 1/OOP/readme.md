# 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice

This repository is dedicated to my journey in mastering **Object-Oriented Programming** principles and techniques.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong foundation in:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Design principles and patterns
- OOP thinking and structure

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- 🔸 **Java** – My primary language for practicing OOP, since it offers strong object-oriented features and is widely used in industry and academia.
- 🔹 **Other languages** – I may occasionally use Python, Javascript, or others to compare how OOP is implemented across different paradigms and ecosystems.

## 🧪 What to Expect

- Small projects, exercises, and pattern-based implementations
- Well-structured code showcasing OOP best practices
- Notes and examples exploring real-world applications of OOP
- Folder-based organization per topic or project

Stay tuned as I gradually build up this repo into a strong reference for my OOP understanding and applications 🚀
