# 🔧 Data Structures – Practical Implementation Journey

Welcome to my **Data Structures** practice repository!  
This space is dedicated to learning, building, and implementing core data structures through hands-on coding and problem-solving.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to **deeply understand data structures** by:

- Implementing each one from scratch (not relying on built-in abstractions).
- Solving practical problems to demonstrate its real-world use.
- Writing in multiple programming languages for variety and comparison.

---

## 🧱 What You'll Find

For each data structure, you’ll find:

- 🔨 One or more **practical problems** solved using that data structure.
- 💻 Implementations in **different languages** through over all journy to have good experince :
  - C (primary focus)
  - Python
  - Java
  - JavaScript

## 🖥️ Why C?

Although I use multiple languages, **C will be the main language** throughout this journey.

> Because C brings you closer to how data structures actually work in memory – with manual memory management, pointer manipulation, and true control over structure layout.

That makes it the perfect tool for building a strong, low-level foundation in CS and understanding what higher-level languages often hide.

## 🧩 Data Structures Covered (Planned)

- [x] Arrays
- [ ] Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- [ ] Stacks & Queues
- [ ] Trees (Binary, BST, AVL)
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] Hash Tables
- [ ] Graphs (Adjacency List & Matrix)
- [ ] Tries
- [ ] Disjoint Sets (Union-Find)

> I’ll be adding structured folders, each containing implementations, sample problems, and notes.

## 🚀 Progress & Philosophy

This repo is being built **step-by-step**, not all at once.  
It's a learning log as much as it is a portfolio.

I aim for:

- Clear logic.
- Code that reflects **understanding**, not copying.
- Readability over perfection.
