# 🔌 Basic Logic Gates – CircuitVerse

This directory demonstrates the implementation of fundamental logic gates using [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/), along with a composite logic expression.

## 📁 Included Circuits

1. **AND Gate**
2. **OR Gate**
3. **NOT Gate**
4. **Combined Logic**:  
   \[(A AND B) OR (NOT A)\]
5. **practice dir that contain:
   5.1. 1's and 2's compelments practice
   5.2 gates drawing using CV and their tabels**

---

This demonstrates how basic logic building blocks can be composed to form more complex expressions.
