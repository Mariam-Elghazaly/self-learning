# 🧠 Logic Design Projects – CircuitVerse

This branch contains digital logic circuits designed using [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/), a powerful browser-based simulator for learning and prototyping digital systems.

## 📁 Structure

Each circuit project in this branch includes:

- A `.cv` file: The **CircuitVerse project file** (JSON-based format used by CircuitVerse)
- A `README.md` file: A short explanation of **what the circuit does**, how it works, and any design notes

> ✅ This makes each logic project clear, organized, and understandable for both learners and reviewers.


## 📄 About the `.cv` File

The file(s) in this branch have the extension `.cv`, which stands for **CircuitVerse project file**.

- Although `.cv` files are technically JSON files, they are **intended to be opened using the CircuitVerse platform**.
- Do **not** open them as plain text or in a JSON editor — they’re meant for logic simulation.

## 🚀 How to Open the Project

You can open any `.cv` file in [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/) by following these steps:

1. Go to [https://circuitverse.org](https://circuitverse.org)
2. Log in or sign up for a free account
3. Click on your profile menu and select **“My Projects”**
4. Press the **“Import Project”** button
5. Choose the `.cv` file you downloaded from this repo
6. Click **“Upload”** – your circuit will now be available and editable

🛠️ Each subfolder will represent a separate circuit project with its own `.cv` file and description.  
This makes it easy to browse, learn from, and reuse the designs.
