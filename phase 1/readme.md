# This phase is a three-week phase, during which I will add to my core concepts, making them clearer, cleaner, and more practical through small projects.

-> My goal from this phase is to master problem-solving, core CS, and programming thinking.

# This will be done by building on my foundation:

- Math (Calc, discrete, and linear).
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- OOP
- Logic design.
